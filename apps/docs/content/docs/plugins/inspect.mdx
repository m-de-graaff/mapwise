# Inspect Plugin

The Inspect plugin enables interactive feature inspection by clicking on the map.

## Installation

The inspect logic is part of the `@mapwise/plugins` package.

```tsx
import { createInspectPlugin } from '@mapwise/plugins';
```

## Usage

Register the plugin with your map controller:

```tsx
controller.plugins.register(createInspectPlugin());
controller.interaction.setActive("inspect", true);
```

## Events

The plugin emits `feature:click` events when a feature is clicked.

```tsx
controller.events.on("feature:click", (event) => {
  console.log("Clicked feature:", event.feature);
});
```
