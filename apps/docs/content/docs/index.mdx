# Mapwise Documentation

Mapwise is a modern, modular, and high-performance mapping solution built on top of MapLibre GL JS. It is designed as a monorepo containing a core headless engine, a comprehensive UI library, specialized layer handlers, and an extensible plugin system.

## Architecture

Mapwise is built around a headless core that manages state and logic, completely decoupled from the UI.

- **[@mapwise/core](/docs/core)**: The brain of the operation. Handles map lifecycle, state management, events, and layer registration.
- **[@mapwise/ui](/docs/ui)**: A polished React component library. Provides ready-to-use components like `MapShell`, `MapToolbar`, and `LayerPanel`.
- **[@mapwise/layers](/docs/layers)**: Specialized logic for different layer types (WMS, GeoJSON, PMTiles, etc.).
- **[@mapwise/plugins](/docs/plugins)**: Extensions that add functional capabilities like drawing, measuring, and more.

## Key Concepts

### Headless Core
The core engine is framework-agnostic (though it provides React adapters). It acts as a wrapper around MapLibre GL JS, adding robust state management, a strictly typed event bus, and a layer registry that abstracts away the complexity of raw map manipulation.

### Declarative Layers
Layers are defined as data objects, not imperative code. The `LayerRegistry` takes care of adding, removing, ordering, and updating layers on the map, preventing common synchronization issues.

### Plugin System
Functionality is additive. Core is lean, and features are added via plugins that have full access to the map controller and event bus.
