# Event System

Mapwise uses a strongly-typed event bus to handle communication between the map, layers, and plugins.

## Event Bus

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/core/src/events/event-bus.ts"
  name="EventBus"
/>

## Event Map

All available events in the system.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/core/src/events/event-types.ts"
  name="EventMap"
/>
