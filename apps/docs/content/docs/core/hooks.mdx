# Built-in React Hooks

Hooks let you use different Mapwise features from your components. This page lists all built-in Hooks in `@mapwise/core`.

## Map Hooks

Map hooks allow you to access the central `MapController` and check the map's readiness state.

- [`useMap`](/docs/core/hooks/map-hooks#usemap) reads the current map context.
- [`useMapController`](/docs/core/hooks/map-hooks#usemapcontroller) returns the controller directly, useful when you are sure the map is ready.
- [`useMapReady`](/docs/core/hooks/map-hooks#usemapready) returns a boolean indicating if the map is fully loaded.

## Layer Hooks

Layer hooks allow you to subscribe to the state of layers. Using these hooks ensures your UI updates automatically when layers are added, removed, or modified.

- [`useLayerState`](/docs/core/hooks/layer-hooks#uselayerstate) subscribes to the state of a specific layer (visibility, opacity, etc.).
- [`useAllLayers`](/docs/core/hooks/layer-hooks#usealllayers) subscribes to the list of all registered layers.
- [`useLayersByCategory`](/docs/core/hooks/layer-hooks#uselayersbycategory) subscribes to layers filtered by their category (e.g., 'base', 'overlay').

## Event Hooks

Event hooks let you listen to map events like clicks, moves, or layer changes.

- [`useMapEvent`](/docs/core/hooks/event-hooks#usemapevent) subscribes to a single map event.
- [`useMapEvents`](/docs/core/hooks/event-hooks#usemapevents) subscribes to multiple map events at once.

## Usage Example

Here is a simple example showing how to combine these hooks:

```tsx
import { useMap, useLayerState } from '@mapwise/core/react';

function LayerControl({ layerId }) {
  const { isReady } = useMap();
  const layer = useLayerState(layerId);

  if (!isReady) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!layer) return <div>Layer not found</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="checkbox" 
        checked={layer.visible} 
        onChange={/* update logic */} 
      />
      {layer.id}
    </div>
  );
}
```
