# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. This will guide you through
the process of adding a changeset that describes your changes.

## Releasing

To release new versions:

1. Run `pnpm version-packages` to consume changesets and update versions
2. Review the changes and commit
3. Run `pnpm release` to build and publish packages
